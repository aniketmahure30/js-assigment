    <p>JavaScript Data Types introduction</p>


    <pre>
        JavaScript includes data types similar to other programming languages like Java or C. Data type indicates characteristics of data.
         It tells the compiler whether the data value is numeric, alphabetic, date etc., so that it can perform the appropriate operation.

        JavaScript includes primitive and non-primitive data types as per latest ECMAScript 5.1.

       <b> Primitive Data Types</b>
        String : represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
        Number : represents numeric values e.g. 100
        Boolean : represents boolean value either false or true
        Null : represents null i.e. no value at all
        Undefined : represents undefined value

        <b>Non-primitive Data Type</b>
        Object : represents instance through which we can access members
        Date : represents the current date and time form computer
        Array : represents group of similar values
        
        JavaScript is a dynamic or loosely-typed language because a variable can hold value of any data type at any point of time.
